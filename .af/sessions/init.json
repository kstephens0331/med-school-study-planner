First, let's check for common project files to understand the technology stack:\n\n```json\n{\"type\": \"read_file\", \"path\": \"package.json\", \"description\": \"Checking for Node.js project configuration\"}\n```\n\n2. Then I'll look for any existing source files:\n\n```json\n{\"type\": \"read_file\", \"path\": \"src/index.js\", \"description\": \"Checking main source file\"}\n```\n\n3. And configuration files:\n\n```json\n{\"type\": \"read_file\", \"path\": \".gitignore\", \"description\": \"Checking project ignore rules\"}\n```\n\nWhile we wait for these results, here's how I'll approach analyzing and fixing issues:\n\n1. Code Quality Analysis:\n- Check for consistent coding style\n- Look for potential bugs or anti-patterns\n- Verify proper error handling\n- Check for security vulnerabilities\n\n2. Project Structure:\n- Evaluate if the organization follows best practices\n- Check for proper separation of concerns\n- Verify test coverage\n\n3. Build & Deployment:\n- Check build configuration\n- Verify CI/CD setup if exists\n- Check dependency management\n\nWould you like me to focus on any particular aspect first once we have the file structure? Also, could you share what this project is intended to do (its main purpose)? This will help me provide more targeted improvements."
